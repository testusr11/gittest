What this text is about

I would like to contribute 
to Uncle Bob’s concept of The Clean Architecture by


demonstrating how its principles could be applied to an 
actual Go application. It doesn’t


make much sense to completely
rephrase Uncle Bob’s blog post here, thus reading his 
text first is definitely a prerequisite for understanding mine.
